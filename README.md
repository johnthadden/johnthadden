- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnthadden
- 👀 I’m interested entrepreneurship and technology. I love improving the quality of people's lives and I know I'll be able to make the biggest impact through technology. I'm currently working on a social media mobile application (think TikTok, Instagram, etc.), but have several other products I'm looking to 'invent' as I develop my coding and other technical abilities.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying at Bellevue University under a degree in software development. Database development and Java are my current studies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me help you. I am looking to transition into a software development career and I am no stranger to hard work (I've run a restaurant for years in COVID times...). I'll be exploring projects and doing what I can to get better and get noticed.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out via email: john.t.hadden@gmail.com

I look forward to working with everyone!
